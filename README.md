# Global Combat
....is a Risk like web based game in which turns are taken simultaneously. Since it is played over the internet, actions are hidden from your enemies until the turn runs.

GLOBAL COMBAT has a WW1 era motif and contains a Elo based rating system which rewards players depending on their place in the game, not just whether they win or lose.

This leads to the political side to GLOBAL COMBAT, in which you must sometimes forge alliances in order to survive, fighting not just to win, but for your honor...

# Project Status
Originally launched on 2001-01-22 Global Combat.

After hosting the game for over twenty five years, we're considering the difficult decision to take the site offline.

To honor the players who played the game every day for over twenty years, I'm open sourcing the code for the game here. I salute you.
